Universal LPC Spritesheet Character Generator
=============================================

Modified version of https://github.com/jrconway3/Universal-LPC-spritesheet for YIRL engine

Based on [Universal LPC Spritesheet](https://github.com/jrconway3/Universal-LPC-spritesheet).

Try it out [here](https://sanderfrenken.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/).

The project you are looking now is an expansion on the above mentioned projects. I try to include all LPC created art up to now.

The Liberated Pixel Effort is a collaborative effort from a number of different great artists who helped produce sprites for the project.
**If you wish to use LPC sprites in your project, you will need to credit everyone who helped contribute to the LPC sprites you are using.** See below for how to do this. 

### Licensing and Attribution (Credits)

All art distributed with this project (all images in the `spritesheets` subdirectory) is licensed under the [GNU GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) ([text](gpl-3_0.txt)) and/or [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) ([text](cc-by-sa-3_0.txt)) license(s). Some art may be available under other licenses too.

The file `CREDITS.csv` lists the authors, license(s), and links to the original URL(s), for each image in `spritesheets`. **If you generate a sprite using this tool, you must credit all the authors**. You can do this one of two ways:

- Distribute the entire `CREDITS.csv` file along with your project. 
- Based on the layers you use, copy the appropriate rows from `CREDITS.csv` into a new file and distribute that file with your project. 

Either way, make sure this credits file is accessible from within your game or app and can be reasonably discovered by users (for instance, show the information on the "Credits" screen directly, or provide a visible link). If you don't want to *show* the entire credits file directly, should include a statement like this on your credits screen:

> Sprites contributed as part of the Liberated Pixel Cup project from OpenGameArt.org: http://opengameart.org/content/lpc-collection
> License: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>

We are working on allowing the generator to build a customized credits file for you. 

### Contributing

**Important: all art submitted to this project must be available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and/or the [GNU GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) licenses**. 
- **By contributing original work to this project, you agree to license any orginal contributions made by you under _both_ of these licenses.**
- If you are submitting art that was made by (or derived from work made by) someone else, please be sure that you have the rights to distribute that art under one of the two licenses. 

When adding files to the project, please add a row to `CREDITS.csv` for each file you add. Note the entire list of authors for that image, a URL for each piece of art from which this image is derived, and a list of licenses under which the art is available.

### Run

To run this project, just clone the repo and open ``index.html`` in your browser of choice.

### Caution

This is not an example of a perfectly coded project, and it does have bugs.
In my current project I am using the generator to create a vast amount of awesome different characters, and the results are beautiful.

Still, feel free to enhance the code where you like, but for now, I focus on just adding content.

### Status

Support still working on:

- [Teens](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-teen-unisex-base-clothes)
